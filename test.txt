The harvesting of wine grapes (Vintage) is one of the most crucial steps in the process of winemaking.
The time of harvest is determined primarily by the ripeness of the grape as measured by sugar, acid and tannin levels with winemakers basing their decision to pick based on the style of wine they wish to produce.
